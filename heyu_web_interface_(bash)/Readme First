Welcome to the heyu web interface.

This document will get you acquainted with what heyu web interface is and how to get it started.

### Welcome

First, if you've downloaded this and happened to be wondering what it does let me just say thanks for downloading.  
This is a CGI script.  The script runs on a web server from your local computer.  It is intended to be ran on a Linux-type OS.
This is because the script uses the native shell interpreter called bash to run.  Any language such as PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, C/C++ will do but
I tend to favor bash because it's pretty easy and less prone to breakage if done right.  

### Basic stuff

Now as for getting this script up and running you could save some time on the matter by learning what a CGI is, what a server sided script is, what a client sided script is,
why the differences and what security threats my happen if you run a CGI publicly from your machine.  It would also be helpful if you learned what a web server does and 
how it handles CGI scripts. Personally I use Apache as it dose the job.  Included in the help folder is an apache configuration example for hosting the CGI.  
If you're already proficient in web servers and also knowledgeable about CGI then pretty much your questions may be more towards how the script works.

### The Script

The script works by talking to heyu.  It reads the configuration file that is included and returns a pretty web interface from where you can control your units.
It also gives you access to simple yet powerful tools.  To just name a few, the heyu manual pages, a cron frontend, upload schedules to the cm11a.


### Finally

If you run in to issues which is probably reasonably in question with open source stuff just email me.  I'm pretty quick to answer most questions but there are times I
just forget so don't take it personally.  Just email me again.
